Win32::GUIRobot
===============

The module is a superset of Win32::GuiTest module functionaliy, with
addition of simple analyzis of graphic output. The module is useful
where analysis based on enumeration of window by title, class, etc is
not enough (in particular in Citrix environment), by providing searching
of arbitrary graphic bits on the screen.

The module is a mixed bag of various win32 functions with the same
purpose as Win32::GuiTest - to provide environment for batch windows
GUI tests/macros, but also focusing on code logic reuse when many
similar GUI scripts should be written. Therefore, in addition to image
search, the module also features a set of wrapper functions to win32
API, timers, etc.

Image operations, -- loading, retrieving information etc is based on
Prima, which can work not only on win32, so basically the module can be
of limited use on X11, for searching sub-images in images. Possibly
this functionality is worth releasing as a stand-alone module, but OTOH
the search is not limited to the Prima toolkit, and can be trivially
implemented using any other image system, not to say that the searching
itself is very simple, and being abstracted from image toolkit calls, is
a single regexp.
